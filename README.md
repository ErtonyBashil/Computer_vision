# Computer vision project
<hr><br>

In this public repository I share with my comunity some of my hands-on projects in Artificial intelligence I have working on in the last couple of year 
This repository cover computer vision projects.

1. Images transformation

The application of different convolutions filters (layers) on images

2. Edge detection

We recover contour line keys, for instance, detect the lines in a football or tennis court
